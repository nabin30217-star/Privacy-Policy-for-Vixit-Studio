Welcome to **Vixit Studio** ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Android application (the "App") collects, uses, and shares your information.

### 2.1. Personal Information
We **do not** collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or phone number.

### 2.2. Media and Files
The App is a video editing and conversion tool. It processes video, audio, and image files stored on your device.

### 2.3. Usage Data and Diagnostics
We may use third-party services (such as Google AdMob) that collect non-personally identifiable information to serve advertisements and analyze app performance. This data may include:

*   Operating system version
*   Advertising ID (AAID)
*   Network connection type
*   General app usage data (e.g., sessions, crash logs)

## 3. Permissions We Request

To function correctly, the App requires the following permissions:

*   **Read/Write External Storage (or Photos/Videos/Audio on Android 13+):** Required to access the media files you want to edit and to save the finished result to your device.
*   **Notifications (`POST_NOTIFICATIONS`):** Used to inform you when a long-running video export or conversion task is finished.
*   **Foreground Service (`FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROCESSING`):** Required to keep the App running in the background while it processes your videos (e.g., merging, reversing, or compressing), ensuring the system does not kill the process during long operations.
*   **Wake Lock (`WAKE_LOCK`):** Keeps the device CPU awake during video processing to prevent interruptions.
*   **Internet Access (`INTERNET`):** Required solely for displaying advertisements and checking for app updates (if applicable). It is **not** used to upload your media files.
